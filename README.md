Code and data used for the study entitled "The reciprocal relation between reading skill and automatic orthographic activation during an auditory phonological awareness task", authored by Jin Wang, Marc Joanisse, and James Booth

The excel shows the specific subject number and runs used for data analysis, which are pulled from a shared dataset on OpenNeuro.org (Wang, Lytle, Weiss, Yamasaki, & Booth, 2021, https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds003604/versions/1.0.2)

The code is the example when I analyze the 5-7-year-old age range. The same code is used for the older cohort of children age from 7-9-year-olds. Different pediatric templates were used for different cohort. ELP_55_85Template is the code to develop template for the younger cohort. ELP_7_105Template is the code to develop template for the older cohort.
